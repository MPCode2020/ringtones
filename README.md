# _**Ringtones**_, a collection by Mark Primak

> I decided to, once a week, upload an interesting audio file that can be used as a ringtone.

Latest ringtone: <audio controls src="latest.mp3">

### Goal
I'm trying to prove to myself that I can commit to doing something long-term, and carry out the commitment to the best of my ability. 
That, and also indulging myself with music once in a while. 

### What qualifies as a *ringtone*?
According to the Google / Oxford Languages:
> **ring·tone**
> 
> /ˈriNGˌtōn/
> 
> _noun_
> 
> a sound made by a mobile phone when an incoming call is received.

That's pretty accurate, but it's a bit bare.
In my experience, a ringtone is **a short, sometimes personalized audio file played by a phone _on loop_ to signal an incoming call**. 

### How these ringtones are made
I'm quite into music and sometimes come across a portion of a song that's quite interesting in one way or another, and end up thinking something on the lines of, 
_damn, that'd make a good ringtone..._ The process for making one of these is quite simple. 
I take the mp3 for the song and trim it, or, if there's vocals that don't exactly play well as part of a ringtone, I separate them with any ol' online vocal remover.
